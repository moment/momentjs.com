p By default, moment parses in local time. If you want to parse a moment in UTC, you can use the following methods.
pre
  | moment.utc() // current date/time in UTC mode
  | moment.utc(Number) // milliseconds since the Unix Epoch in UTC mode
  | moment.utc([Number, ...]) // parse an array of numbers matching Date.UTC() parameters
  | moment.utc(String) // parse string into UTC mode
  | moment.utc(String, String) // parse a string and format into UTC mode
p This brings us to an interesting feature of moment.js, UTC mode.
p While in UTC mode, all display methods will display in UTC time instead of local time.
p Any moment created with 
  code moment()
  |  will not be in UTC mode, and any moments created with 
  code moment.utc()
  |  will be in UTC mode.
p To switch from UTC to local time, you can use
  code moment.fn.utc
  |  or
  code moment.fn.local
  | .
pre
  | var a = moment.utc([2011, 0, 1, 8]);
  | a.hours(); // 8 UTC
  | a.local();
  | a.hours(); // 0 PST
