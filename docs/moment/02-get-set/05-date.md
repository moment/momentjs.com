Gets or sets the day of the month.

Accepts numbers from 1 to 31. If the range is exceeded, it will bubble up to the months.

**Note:** `Moment#date` is for the date of the month, and `Moment#day` is for the day of the week.

**Note:** if you chain multiple actions to construct a date, you should start from a year, then a month, then a day etc. Otherwise you may get unexpected results, like when `day=31` and current month has only 30 days (the same applies to native JavaScript `Date` manipulation), the returned date will be 1st of the following month.

Bad: `moment().date(day).month(month).year(year)`

Good: `moment().year(year).month(month).date(day)`

**2.16.0** deprecated using ``moment().dates()``. Use ``moment().date()`` instead.
