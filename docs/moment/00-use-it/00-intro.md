Moment was designed to work both in the browser and in Node.js.

All code should work in both of these environments, and all unit tests are run in both of these environments.

Currently, the following browsers are used for the ci system: Chrome on Windows XP, IE 8, 9, and 10 on Windows 7,
IE 11 on Windows 10, latest Firefox on Linux, and latest Safari on OSX 10.8 and 10.11.
