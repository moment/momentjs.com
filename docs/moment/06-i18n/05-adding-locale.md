title: Adding your locale to Moment.js
---


To add your locale to Moment.js, submit a pull request with both a locale file and a test file. You can find examples in `moment/src/locale/fr.js` and `moment/src/test/locale/fr.js`.

To run the tests in Node.js, do `npm install`, then `grunt`.

If all the tests pass, submit a pull request, and thank you for contributing!
