title: Adding your language to Moment.js
---


To add your language to Moment.js, submit a pull request with both a language file and a test file. You can find examples in `moment/lang/fr.js` and `moment/test/lang/fr.js`.

To run the tests in Node.js, do `npm install`, then `grunt`.

If all the tests pass, submit a pull request, and thank you for contributing!
