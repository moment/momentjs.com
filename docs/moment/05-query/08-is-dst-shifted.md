title: Is DST Shifted
version: 2.3.0-2.14.0
signature: |
  moment('2013-03-10 2:30', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm').isDSTShifted()

**Note:** As of version **2.14.0** this function is **deprecated**. It doesn't give
the right answer after modifying the moment object. For more information refert
to [moment/3160](https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/3160)

Another important piece of validation is to know if the date has been moved by a DST. For example, in most of the United States:

```javascript
moment('2013-03-10 2:30', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm').format(); //=> '2013-03-10T01:30:00-05:00'
```

This is because daylight saving time shifts the time from 2:00 to 3:00, so 2:30 isn't a real time. The resulting time is browser-dependent, either adjusting the time forward or backwards. Use `moment#isDSTShifted` to test for this condition.

**Note:** before **2.3.0**, Moment objects in this condition always returned `false` for `moment#isValid`; they now return `true`.
