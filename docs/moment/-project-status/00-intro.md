Moment.js has been successfully used in millions of projects, and we are happy to have contributed to making date and time better on the Web!
However, we now consider Moment to be a "legacy" project.  It is not *dead*, but it is indeed *done*.

**This means:**

- We will not be adding new features or capabilities
- We may choose to not fix behavioral quirks or long-standing bugs
- We may choose to not make corrections to locale strings or date formats
- We *will* address critical security concerns as they arise
- We *will* release data updates for Moment-Timezone as necessary

In most cases, you should not choose Moment for new projects.
