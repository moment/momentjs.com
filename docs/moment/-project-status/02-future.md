title: The Future

One day soon, we hope there won't be a strong need for date and time libraries in JavaScript at all.  Instead, we will be able to use capabilities of the JavaScript language itself.

The work to make this a reality is being done in [The ECMA TC39 Temporal Proposal](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/index.html).

You can try out Temporal today, via [an experimental polyfill](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/tree/main/polyfill).  Please give it a try, but don't use it in production (yet)!

Please also consider contributing to this effort, especially if you have experience using Moment or other date and time libraries.
