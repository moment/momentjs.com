This is a Moment.js plugin that allows the use of timers, which offer much more control than the native JavaScript timers. 
It's basically a rewrite of JavaScripts own setInterval and setTimeout.

For example,

```javascript
var timer = moment.duration(5, "seconds").timer({loop: true}, function() { 
  // Callback 
});
```
