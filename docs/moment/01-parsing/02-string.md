When creating a moment from a string, we first check if the string matches known [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) formats, we then check if the string matches the [RFC 2822 Date time](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#section-3.3) format before dropping to the fall back of `new Date(string)` if a known format is not found.

```javascript
var day = moment("1995-12-25");
```

**Warning:** Browser support for parsing strings [is inconsistent](http://dygraphs.com/date-formats.html). Because there is no specification on which formats should be supported, what works in some browsers will not work in other browsers.

<!--
**Note:** This has been the source of a lot of confusion, because moments created via `Date` constructor don't support `isValid` and also work unreliably. So it would be soon deprecated. From version 2.6.0 there is a way to prevent Date constructor usage - just set `moment.createFromInputFallback` to an empty function.
-->

For consistent results parsing anything other than ISO 8601 strings, you should use [String + Format](#/parsing/string-format/).

#### Supported ISO 8601 strings

An ISO 8601 string requires a date part.

```
2013-02-08  # A calendar date part
2013-W06-5  # A week date part
2013-039    # An ordinal date part

20130208    # Basic (short) full date
2013W065    # Basic (short) week, weekday
2013W06     # Basic (short) week only
2013050     # Basic (short) ordinal date
```

A time part can also be included, separated from the date part by a space or a uppercase T.

```
2013-02-08T09            # An hour time part separated by a T
2013-02-08 09            # An hour time part separated by a space
2013-02-08 09:30         # An hour and minute time part
2013-02-08 09:30:26      # An hour, minute, and second time part
2013-02-08 09:30:26.123  # An hour, minute, second, and millisecond time part
2013-02-08 24:00:00.000  # hour 24, minute, second, millisecond equal 0 means next day at midnight

20130208T080910,123      # Short date and time up to ms, separated by comma
20130208T080910.123      # Short date and time up to ms
20130208T080910          # Short date and time up to seconds
20130208T0809            # Short date and time up to minutes
20130208T08              # Short date and time, hours only
```

Any of the date parts can have a time part.

```
2013-02-08 09  # A calendar date part and hour time part
2013-W06-5 09  # A week date part and hour time part
2013-039 09    # An ordinal date part and hour time part
```

If a time part is included, an offset from UTC can also be included as `+-HH:mm`, `+-HHmm`, `+-HH` or `Z`.

```
2013-02-08 09+07:00            # +-HH:mm
2013-02-08 09-0100             # +-HHmm
2013-02-08 09Z                 # Z
2013-02-08 09:30:26.123+07:00  # +-HH:mm
2013-02-08 09:30:26.123+07     # +-HH
```

**Note:** Automatic cross browser ISO-8601 support was added in version **1.5.0**. Support for the week and ordinal formats was added in version **2.3.0**.

If a string does not match any of the above formats and is not able to be parsed with `Date.parse`, `moment#isValid` will return false.

```javascript
moment("not a real date").isValid(); // false
```

#### The RFC 2822 date time format

Before parsing a RFC 2822 date time the string is cleansed to remove any comments and/or newline characters. The additional characters are legal in the format but add nothing to creating a valid moment instance.

After cleansing, the string is validated in the following space-separated sections, all using the English language:

```
6 Mar 17 21:22 UT
6 Mar 17 21:22:23 UT
6 Mar 2017 21:22:23 GMT
06 Mar 2017 21:22:23 Z
Mon 06 Mar 2017 21:22:23 z
Mon, 06 Mar 2017 21:22:23 +0000
```

1. Day of Week in three letters, followed by an optional comma. (optional)
2. Day of Month (1 or 2 digit), followed by a three-letter month and 2 or 4 digit year
3. Two-digit hours and minutes separated by a colon (:), followed optionally by another colon and seconds in 2-digits
4. Timezone or offset in one of the following formats:
  1. UT : +0000
  2. GMT : +0000
  3. EST | CST | MST | PST | EDT | CDT | MDT | PDT : US time zones*
  4. A - I | K - Z : Military time zones*
  5. Time offset +/-9999

 [*] See [section 4.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#section-4.3) of the specification for details.

The parser also confirms that the day-of-week (when included) is consistent with the date.
