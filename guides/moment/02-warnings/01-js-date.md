title: JS Date Construction
---
```
Moment construction falls back to js Date. 
This is discouraged and will be removed in an upcoming major release.
```
This deprecation warning is thrown when no known format is found for a date passed into the string constructor.
To work around this issue, specify a format for the string being passed to ``moment()``.
